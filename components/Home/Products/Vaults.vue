          <p>
            Invest and earn up to 15% interest per annum, depending on your
            investment amount. With our vault plan, you can earn interest
            upfront. This plan allows you to lock your money in and grow it. You
            can either choose to reinvest the investment or liquidate it at the
            end of the set date (tenor).
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: Your investment cannot be terminated before maturity as you
            have received your interest upfront.
